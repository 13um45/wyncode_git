Run this command to create a new file:

echo 'Hello world!' > hello_world.txt
Now, whatâ€™s the difference between these two commands?

echo hello_world.txt
cat hello_world.txt

answer:

echo hello_world.txt = printing "hello_world.txt" to the console.
cat hello_world.txt = printing the contents of the file to the console.



Using cat, write a command that takes the contents of one file (hello_world.txt) and copies it into another file (hello_copy.txt).

asnwer:

cat hello_world.txt > hello_copy.txt
